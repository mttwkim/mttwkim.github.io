## Reflection Statement ##

When I first signed up to take this class, I didn’t really know what digital humanities meant. Because the course code had “ENGL” in the title, I assumed it was just another English class that would assign readings, have us analyze them, and hold discussions. I didn’t expect to learn as much as I did about a field I didn’t even know existed. The activity we did in our last class, where everyone came up with a word to define digital humanities, really highlights how this field can be characterized by many different terms. I think the projects and work I’ve done in this class really encapsulate what I now believe digital humanities is.

In the “Stories in the Data” section of *Democracy's Data,* Dan Bouk makes an interesting argument about how we should view and interpret data, using the United States Census as an example. Bouk states that studying only the numbers in a census leads to an “incomplete, possibly distorted picture of the nation,” and that we need to widen our lens to include the “processes that generated those numbers.” I think this quote, and the reading overall, encapsulates the overarching goals we had for both the Printing in Prisons project and the EC project.

For both projects, we started with a large index of *The Umpire* filled with entries defined by tags, newspaper volume numbers, dates, and other sorting variables. From a non-digital humanities perspective, someone might see the index as just a collection of newspapers organized into a spreadsheet. However, through the projects we developed in this class, Bouk’s perspective on data came to life. By diving into the details of the index, I was able to develop a story about a real person who existed within the stories of *The Umpire.* I also incorporated humanizing, interactive elements that allowed me to bring this person’s story to life.

Music has always been something I’m interested in and passionate about, which is why I chose to attend a workshop related to music and cassette tapes that I’ll discuss later. Because of this interest, when I initially scanned for topics, I used music as a keyword and found a lot of information on one specific individual who was heavily involved with the E.S.P. band. While my main goal was to find a topic to write about, I also “got to know” someone from Eastern State in a sense. This familiarization allowed me to handpick pieces of music and information to include in my project. Ultimately, through the Printing in Prisons project, I was able to deeply understand a specific data set instead of viewing it at face value.

Similarly, the EC project had the same purpose as our multimedia essays, but in a physical medium rather than a digital one. Just as we learned to code for the multimedia essay, we learned about different technologies and mediums through which we could convey the data we worked with. For our group, we incorporated fabrics and textiles to tell a story about themes prevalent in *The Umpire.* Dorothy Berry’s article, “The House That Archives Built,” represents the final products we created in this class. Berry discusses how archives can take any form of space that keeps stories and identities alive. I think this applies well to both the Printing in Prisons library our class created and the physical products we made in the EC. At first glance, *The Umpire* index might not seem like a vibrant space where stories and identities are kept, but by collectively examining specific topics, writing essays, and creating physical products, we were able to bring stories to life.

The workshops I attended also reinforced what we did in class. As I mentioned in my reflection, the cassette tape workshop reminded me to look at things on a deeper level and with intention—kind of like an archive. Although a cassette tape might just seem like something that plays music, I learned through the workshop that the process of recording onto tapes is very complex and everything must be done with intention. Overall, it was good reinforcement and practice of viewing things from a digital humanities perspective. Additionally, the Python workshop was a great opportunity to learn about organizing and analyzing data. I could see how Python could be applied to many aspects of our classwork. Although Python was more complicated than HTML and Markdown, I think the two languages can be used together to create complete projects.

Interestingly, the workshops also helped me discover some new interests. While I chose which workshops to attend, I didn’t expect to enjoy the cassette workshop as much as I did. In the future, I want to attend some more fun workshops in Philadelphia. The Python workshop was also a great reinforcement of what I’d learned in and before this class. I hope to use these skills and continue learning on my own in the future.

Reflecting on my work, I think I did a good job exploring my topics thoroughly. I found meaningful information about my Printing in Prisons topic, even discovering articles mentioning my person’s name and activities he was involved in after leaving Eastern State. On the other hand, I think our EC final product could have been better. Given more time and exposure to different technologies in the EC, I think our group could have come up with a more creative and effective idea to convey the information we wanted to display.
