## EC Project Reflection ##

This EC project was a very fun and unique experience that allowed me to connect with the articles within *The Umpire* on a deeper level, while also learning a new form of technology that enabled our group to humanize and convey the data within *The Umpire* in a compelling way. 

In terms of goals, our group wanted to create a final product that effectively conveyed important themes within *The Umpire*. Initially, I found the textures/textiles medium less engaging than some of the other technologies that were more interactive. I also thought that using textures/textiles made it pretty limited in terms of what we could create. Therefore, our group tried our best to brainstorm a product idea that would be cool to make and could convey something about *The Umpire.* Ultimately, our decision to make a data map through nodes and lines was a creative way to incorporate textures/textiles while also relaying how important themes were interconnected. By focusing on the activities and the happenings that the inmates were directly involved in, our group was able to incorporate a humanizing aspect within our product as well.

Our design process involved a lot of trial and error. Because our original nodal diagrams were generated using code, we had to go through multiple iterations to find one that balanced data accuracy and visual aesthetics. This part of our project was what probably took the most time. Before making the nodal diagrams, our group collectively came together and identified different themes from *The Umpire* that we believed were important to include in our final product. This included topics such as the E.S.P Band and the E.S.P. Baseball League. For each draft, our group evaluated what we liked about each draft versus what we wanted to change. Changes included altering the nodes, adjusting and adding lines that connected the nodes together, and refining the overall shape of the nodal diagram.

Overall, I believe that our group did a good job in fulfilling our project goals. Our finished product tells a compelling and interesting story of the connections between topics and themes within *The Umpire,* which tells a story about what life was like at Eastern State. Our project also reveals some details about topics that were not as prominently covered within the newspaper, such as punishment and reform. Still, due to the limited time and resources we had for this project, I think that our finished product definitely overlooks some important topics, as we hand-picked the central topics for the most part. This could have led to the omission of certain important topics. If we were given more time for this project, it would have been nice to incorporate sewn 3D patches for the icons instead of just printing the icons out. This would have added tactility to our design. Furthermore, it would have been interesting to add pushpins at the ends of each line to further give the design a more 3D feeling. Expanding the number of nodes and lines would have also improved our project in terms of conveying data as well.

My designated role within the group was the outreach specialist, so I was in charge of making the PowerPoint slides and organizing what would be said during our presentation. This role was important and required me to be informed about all aspects of the project from ideation to implementation. I believe that I fulfilled my role well, as I was present for all group meetings, both in-person and online, as well as all group working periods within the EC. I even helped with the design process at certain times and edited one of the drafts we were trying to print out.

The dynamic of our group was very collaborative and efficient. I believe that the project manager played an important role in making sure everyone knew what they had to do and when we had to meet, which allowed us to meet important deadlines. Everyone was also helpful in assisting in areas in which they weren’t necessarily assigned to. For example, while my main role was to make the presentation, I also helped with the design process, and others helped me with certain parts of the presentation. I think this fluidity of roles was very beneficial and allowed for our group members to not feel overwhelmed, while also fostering a positive team environment. Although I wouldn’t change much, one aspect I think our group could have done better is coming to the EC more prepared to produce our product. Our group thought that we could not print colors on the fabric but was told that we could on the day of, so we made some changes that day which took us some time that we did not expect.

Overall, this project in the EC was a very unique experience that that allowed our group to produce a final product that highlights important themes within *The Umpire.* I’m glad that we did this project, as I would not have learned how sewing work or how different fabrics can be used on my own accord. Despite limitations in terms of time and resources, I am proud of what our group was able to accomplish.
