## About ##
My name is Matthew Kim and I am a junior at Penn majoring in Neuroscience. This GitHub website showcases my work and serves as a reflection of this past semester in this Digital Humanities class. Through projects and assignments, I have gained new insights into how data and technology can intersect with the humanities. Furthermore, I have learned how these fields can be used together to tell stories and share knowledge. You can read my final statement that details my experience in this class by going back to the main page.
