# Looking Forward

Looking forward, there are some things that I want to do to build on the work that was done in this class and incorporate it into my future learning.

First, I want to attend more workshops on coding languages. Learning Markdown, HTML, and some new aspects of Python in this class was incredibly useful. I taught myself some Python over the summer for data analysis in my research lab, but teaching myself was challenging. The workshop format helped me learn much more efficiently, and I believe attending more workshops, along with doing some studying by myself will help me build a solid foundation in coding, a skill that I think will be valuable for future projects and endeavors.

Second, I want to continue researching Eastern State Penitentiary and *The Umpire* on my own. Visiting Eastern State earlier in the semester was a cool experience that helped me connect with the readings and projects we did in class in a meaningful way.  Now, after all the work we have done in the class, I want to revisit the information to deepen my understanding of the subjects I researched. I also think it would be exciting to explore new topics related to *The Umpire,* because diving down research rabbit holes was one of the most enjoyable parts of this class for me.

Finally, I want to attend more “fun” workshops in Philadelphia with the new mindset I’ve gained through this digital humanities course. The cassette tape workshop, for example, helped me realize my fascination with vintage and retro technology. I want to explore this interest further and see how it might connect to digital humanities or other areas of study.
