## Workshop at Philadelphia Review ##

Attending the open cassette mixtape session was very interesting and felt like taking a step back into a time before being able to open Spotify on your phone and play any song you want to listen to. When I signed up for this workshop, I expected just a fun, somewhat quirky experience transferring my playlist onto a cassette tape, but the workshop turned out to be much more meaningful than I had expected. Learning about the history of cassette tapes, as well as the hands-on process of recording and the technical details of how cassette tapes are recorded on made me realize the ways that cassette tapes could capture memories in ways current digital media forms cannot.

The person facilitating the mixtape session started by telling us about the story of cassette tapes. He mentioned the popularity of tapes in the 1980s and 1990s and the way people used tapes to share music. Today, I can add a song to my playlist by clicking a single button, but recording on a cassette tape required me to hold the record button down for the entire time the song was playing. The first time I was recording, I accidentally let go of the record button, which forced me to start over from the beginning. Because of the amount of time it takes to record something onto a tape, I was forced to think more carefully about the choices I was making and why I wanted particular songs on the tape. The process reminded me that slowing down and being more intentional and thoughtful about certain things can make something as simple as a song feel more special and meaningful.

This experience also related with some of the ideas we have been looking at in class, especially around archives and the preservation of personal experiences. I thought back to *The House Archives Built* article, which talks about how archives are more than just places where old things are stored. They are actually spaces that keep stories and identities alive. The house in the article serves as a cultural archive, which holds memories, voices, and histories that reflect a community’s life and legacy. Similarly, I feel that cassette tapes represent mini personal archives. They serve not only to store music but also to carry the feel of a certain time or a specific mood. The music I chose for my tape was from the early 2000s and has a very retro jazzy hip/hop feel. This was the first time I heard the song in an analog format, and listening back felt almost like opening a time capsule.

It was also interesting to learn about how cassette tapes actually work. The workshop facilitator told us about the recording process and explained how magnetic fields and electric charges imprint sound onto the tape. I also learned that that these tapes degrade over time. Each time you play the cassette. it leaves a little mark, which causes each pause or rewind to wear down the tape down slightly. This fact made me realize that unlike digital files that we use today, physical tapes have a unique “life” to them. This imperfection of the tape actually made the workshop experience more meaningful to me.

*The House Archives Built* article makes an interesting point that physical archives, whether they are houses or cassette tapes, carry a different kind of weight than digital music files. Tapes don’t just save the song, but they also preserve a physical connection to a moment or feeling. At the workshop, holding the cassette in my hand and listening to the songs I chose felt more "real" and authentic than any of the playlists I have ever made on Spotify. 

This workshop left me with a new appreciation for analog media and the the unique way it helps us preserve nostalgia and personal histories. I left this workshop thinking about how sometimes the less convenient and more intentional ways of preserving memories are the ones that stand out to us.
